              <p>
                Hi there! I’m Matt. I’m a career changer from editing and
                content writing to software engineering and technical writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my life, I’ve straddled the bridge between
                “left-brain” and “right-brain” pursuits and career aspirations.
                I started my college journey as a Physics major, but graduated
                with a B.A. in English Literature.
              </p>
              <p>
                After dedicating my early twenties to my dream of writing
                fiction, I found myself missing the satisfaction of concrete
                problem solving and analytical thinking. I started teaching
                myself to code, motivated by the desire to build my own websites
                and applications, and found programming to be the perfect
                synthesis of creative system design and analytical problem
                solving.
              </p>
              <p>
                At that time, I was working as a marketing copywriter, content
                writer, and editor for various tech companies located in the San
                Francisco Bay Area. After discovering my love for programming, I
                realized I wanted a deeper understanding of how the tech tools I
                was writing about were built! At that point, I decided to make a
                full career transition into programming, and enrolled in
                Flatiron School’s Full Stack Software Engineering program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Toward the end of the program, my instructor suggested I apply
                for a teaching position at Flatiron School itself, after
                noticing how I engaged with my peers on our journey together
                through the program. I had always wanted to try teaching, and
                wanted to continue my own programming education, so I applied
                and was hired immediately after I graduated.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it turns out, I absolutely loved teaching! It gave me an
                opportunity to meet so many different people from so many walks
                of life, and was both humbling and inspiring. Few experiences in
                life have been as rewarding as seeing students I taught go on to
                succeed in the industry and work as software engineers.
              </p>

              <p>
                While teaching was deeply rewarding, I knew I wanted to move
                into an engineering or technical writing role where I could
                continue deepening my knowledge and skills. My teaching role was
                great for honing foundational programming principles, but there
                was only so much I was able to learn on the job. I spent many
                hours outside of work studying, researching, and coming up with
                supplemental content to teach to students, but I was and still
                am excited to do more hands-on learning.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I was laid off from Flatiron School, I saw it as a great
                opportunity to improve my own skills, build projects that I’m
                passionate about, and move on to the next step in my career and
                my life. I’ve learned a ton, and am excited to continue my
                growth in my next role!
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of work and programming, I still like to write fiction
                and read. I also love playing music, staying fit and active,
                meditating, and exploring new hobbies, activities, and topics.
                There is so much to do and so many things to learn! I’m excited
                to keep coding, learning, and trying new things!
              </p>

            questions and encouraged us as students to ask them. The first 2
            weeks of Phase 1 were incredibly challenging for me, and
