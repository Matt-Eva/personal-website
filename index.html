              <p>
                Hi there! I’m Matt. I’m a career changer from editing and
                content writing to software engineering and technical writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my life, I’ve straddled the bridge between
                “left-brain” and “right-brain” pursuits and career aspirations.
                I started my college journey as a Physics major, but graduated
                with a B.A. in English Literature.
              </p>
              <p>
                After dedicating my early twenties to my dream of writing
                fiction, I found myself missing the satisfaction of concrete
                problem solving and analytical thinking. I started teaching
                myself to code, motivated by the desire to build my own websites
                and applications, and found programming to be the perfect
                synthesis of creative system design and analytical problem
                solving.
              </p>
              <p>
                At that time, I was working as a marketing copywriter, content
                writer, and editor for various tech companies located in the San
                Francisco Bay Area. After discovering my love for programming, I
                realized I would much rather build and design tools and
                technologies than write about them! At that point, I decided to
                make a full career transition from writing to programming, and
                enrolled in Flatiron School’s Full Stack Software Engineering
                program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Toward the end of the program, my instructor suggested I apply
                for a teaching position at Flatiron School itself, after
                noticing how I helped my peers on our journey together through
                the program. I had always wanted to try teaching, and wanted to
                continue my own programming education, so I applied and was
                hired immediately after I graduated.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it turns out, I absolutely loved teaching! It gave me an
                opportunity to meet so many different people from so many walks
                of life, and was both humbling and inspiring. Few experiences in
                life have been as rewarding as seeing students I taught go on to
                succeed in the industry and work as software engineers.
              </p>

              <p>
                While teaching was deeply rewarding, I knew I would one day move
                on to work as a fully-fledged software engineer. And while the
                role was great for honing foundational programming principles,
                there was only so much I was able to learn on the job. I spent
                many hours outside of work studying, researching, and coming up
                with supplemental content to teach to students, but I was and
                still am excited to do more hands-on learning as an engineer.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I was laid off from Flatiron School, I saw it as a great
                opportunity to improve my own skills, build projects that I’m
                passionate about, and move on to the next step in my career and
                my life. I’ve learned a ton over the last few months, and am
                excited to continue my growth in my next role!
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of work and programming, I still like to write fiction
                and read. I also love playing music, staying fit and active,
                meditating, and exploring new hobbies, activities, and topics.
                There is so much to do and so many things to learn! I still plan
                on writing my own novels, and am currently working on building
                my own suite of online platforms, which I hope to someday run as
                my own businesses. But in the meantime, I’m just excited to keep
                coding, learning, and trying new things!
